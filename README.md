# ohmyzsh -> fish

This project is meant to port some packages from [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh) to fish

Currently, these are just aliases.

All credit goes to the original authors

## Usage

To import all the aliases at once, just run:

``fish import_all.fish``

Because these are all aliases, and I'm using the ``-s`` option on the ``alias`` command, this only has to be run once.

## License

Oh My Zsh is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt), as are the included edits I have made to it.
